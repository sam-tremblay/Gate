# Gate for WordPress
## _My installation WP on MIT licence._
This installation of WordPress based on NodeJS, Gulp and a mind for the custom made has for objective to allow my Web Agency, people wanna use Gate and I to construct and deliver good & complex WordPress stuffs.

> **WARNING:** IF YOU USE GATE V4.2 OR LESS, DON'T UPDATE YOUR INSTALLATION WITH THIS REPO. MASTER BRANCH CONTENTS THE VERSION 4.3 AND THIS VERSION IS A BREAKUP WITH 4.2.
>
> #### Breakup explanation
>3 points:
>- We stop our support for WPML. Instead, we use Polylang (But in really case, it's not a problem, you can use what plugin you want.);
>
>- We stop our support for Locomotive Scroll. Instead, we have extended the use of Gsap by purchasing a license. Now, you can call ScrollTrigger and ScrollSmoother of Gsap;
>
>- We pushed major updates with a new mind for Gate. How the Gulp Structure work has changed, idem for our parent theme and our Gate plugin has been replaced by a collection of plugins to let you set up what you really need.
