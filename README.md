Gate is an open and evolutive project that help me to start and deliver good and complex WordPress Stuffs with ACF and WPML only.

## What can I do with Gate

- Create professional and instinctive Admin Panels
- Create Custom Post Types and their taxonomies quickly
- Remove default roles or not and create new ones
- Sort Post Types with Drag & Drop
- Manage some repeat situations like menu locations, ACF Options Pages, SEO management, etc.
- Work with Next Generation of codes with Node and Gulp-babel

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Can I install other plugins than ACF and WPML?**
  - Yes! But you should know that Gate already manages SEO, Google Analytics connection, Custom Post Types and their taxonomies and roles. From these facts, avoid installing plugins that handle these things.
